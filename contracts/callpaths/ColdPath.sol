/* @title Cold path callpath sidecar.
 * @notice Defines a proxy sidecar contract that's used to move code outside the 
 *         main contract to avoid Ethereum's contract code size limit. Contains
 *         top-level logic for non trade related logic, including protocol control,
 *         pool initialization, and surplus collateral payment. 
 * 
 * @dev    This exists as a standalone contract but will only ever contain proxy code,
 *         not state. As such it should never be called directly or externally, and should
 *         only be invoked with DELEGATECALL so that it operates on the contract state
 *         within the primary CrocSwap contract. */
