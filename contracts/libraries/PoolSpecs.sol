     *         markts with different underlying behavior to the AMM. 
     *
     * @param feeRate_ The overall fee (liquidity fees + protocol fees inclusive) that
     *            swappers pay to the pool as a fraction of notional. Represented as an 
     *            integer representing hundredeths of a basis point. I.e. a 0.25% fee 
     *            would be 250000
     * @param protocolTake_ The fraction of the fee rate that goes to the protocol fee 
     *             (the rest accumulates as a liquidity fee to LPs). Represented as 1/n. 
     *             Special case of zero, means the protocol take is 0%.
     * @param tickSize The minimum granularity of price ticks defining a grid, on which 
     *          range orders may be placed. (Outside off-grid price improvement facility.)
     *          For example a value of 50 would mean that range order bounds could only
     *          be placed on every 50th price tick, guaranteeing a minimum separation of
     *          0.005% (50 one basis point ticks) between bump points.
     * @param permitOracle Address pointing to an external smart contract that controls
     *          the permissioned access to the pool. If zero, access to the pool is 
     *          permissionless. */
